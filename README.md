# insert-date

Sublime Text 3 plugin to insert the current local date or time at the location 
of the first cursor. This will replace any selected text.

Date: "`ctrl+alt+shift+d`". Date is formatted '`YYYY-MM-DD `'.
Time: "`ctrl+alt+shift+t`". Time is formatted '`HH:MM `'.

At the moment the only default keymap is for Windows.

My first Sublime plugin. I wanted a simple way to insert the time or date when
I am writing notes. The Package Control website was experiencing an unknown 
error so I had to write my own. 

The tutorial at https://cnpagency.com/blog/creating-sublime-text-3-plugins-part-1/ helped me get started.
