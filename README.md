# insert-date

Sublime Text 3 plugin to insert the current local date or time at the location 
of the first cursor. This will replace any selected text. At the moment there
is only a Windows default keymap.

## Installation
Locate your Sublime Text folder and clone this repository to 
`Sublime/Data/Packages`.<br>
To uninstall, delete the folder `Sublime/Data/Packages/insert-date`.

## Usage
Date: `ctrl+alt+shift+d`. Date is formatted `YYYY-MM-DD `.<br>
Time: `ctrl+alt+shift+t`. Time is formatted `HH:MM `. <br>
Both the date and the time have a space at the end.

## Notes and Acknowledgement
My first Sublime plugin. I wanted a simple way to insert the time or date when
I am writing notes. The Package Control website was experiencing an unknown 
error so I had to write my own.
