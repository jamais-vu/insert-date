# insert-date

A Sublime Text 3 plugin to insert the current local date or time. 

## Installation
Locate your Sublime Text folder and clone this repository to 
`Sublime/Data/Packages`.<br>
To uninstall, delete the folder `Sublime/Data/Packages/insert-date`.

## Usage
The following key bindings will insert the date or time at the position of
the first cursor in the current file. This will replace any selected text.

**Date**: `alt+shift+d`. Date is formatted `YYYY-MM-DD `.<br>
**Time**: `alt+shift+t`. Time is formatted `HH:MM `, using the 24 hr clock. <br>

Both the date and the time have a space at the end.

## Notes and Acknowledgement
My first Sublime plugin. I wanted a simple way to insert the time or date when
I am writing in my journal. The Sublime Package Control website was experiencing
an unknown error so I chose to make my own plugin.
