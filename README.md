# insert-date

Sublime Text 3 plugin to insert the current local date or time at the location 
of the first cursor. This will replace any selected text. Both the date and the
time have a space after them.

Usage:<br>
Date: `ctrl+alt+shift+d`. Date is formatted `YYYY-MM-DD `.<br>
Time: `ctrl+alt+shift+t`. Time is formatted `HH:MM `.

At the moment there is only a Windows default keymap.

My first Sublime plugin. I wanted a simple way to insert the time or date when
I am writing notes. The Package Control website was experiencing an unknown 
error so I had to write my own.

helped me get started.
